## Running the Pipeline

```bash
# Full run from topic → final_reel.mp4
python pipeline.py --topic "AI agents explained in 3 steps"

# From a transcript file
python pipeline.py --transcript path/to/transcript.txt

# Skip stage 1 (use existing script)
python pipeline.py --script assets/script_data.json

# From a research JSON (output of the topic-research pipeline)
# Extracts topic + hook_angle + why + outlier_ref and feeds them into Stage 1
python pipeline.py --research-json path/to/research_output.json

# Dry run — generate script only, print JSON, do not call external APIs
python pipeline.py --topic "..." --dry-run

# Skip individual stages (reuse existing assets)
python pipeline.py --topic "..." --skip-broll
python pipeline.py --topic "..." --skip-avatar
python pipeline.py --topic "..." --skip-music
```

## Running Individual Stages

```bash
# Stage 1 only — script generation (reads reference files, calls Claude API, writes assets/script_data.json)
python3 stages/stage1_script.py --topic "..."

# Stage 2 only — B-roll (reads assets/script_data.json, calls Kie.ai Runway, writes assets/broll/)
python3 stages/stage2_broll.py

# Stage 3 only — avatar (reads assets/script_data.json, calls HeyGen, writes assets/avatar/avatar_video.mp4)
python3 stages/stage3_avatar.py

# Stage 4 only — BGM + stings (calls Kie.ai ElevenLabs, writes assets/music/)
# Generates: track1_tension.mp3, track2_warm.mp3, sting1/2/3.mp3, hook_sting.mp3
python3 stages/stage4_music.py

# Stage 5 only — compose (runs Whisper → sync timestamps → Remotion render)
python3 stages/stage5_compose.py

# Stage 6 only — analyse rendered video and score on DSSCL
python3 stages/stage6_analyse.py
python3 stages/stage6_analyse.py assets/final/final_reel.mp4   # custom path

# Remotion preview (hot-reload during component development)
cd remotion && npx remotion studio
```

## Utility Scripts

```bash
# Align broll section timestamps to actual Whisper speech — run after stage5 Whisper step,
# before Remotion render, whenever you have a new avatar video.
# Updates: start_sec/end_sec per section, bgm_dip_timestamps, bgm_transition_sec, total_duration_sec
python3 speech/sync_broll_to_speech.py
python3 speech/sync_broll_to_speech.py --dry-run   # preview without writing

# Regenerate specific broll clips (watermark, wrong scene, etc.)
python3 broll/regenerate_broll.py body_1 emotion_save

# Generate DSSCL analysis doc with per-score commentary
# Writes: scripts/generated/script_analysis.md + script_data_snapshot.json
python3 -c "exec(open('scripts/generate_analysis.py').read())"  # (inline, see section below)

# Pre-evaluate script quality BEFORE spending on HeyGen/Kie.ai (cheap text-only check)
# Returns DSSCL score + issues list + go/no-go — runs automatically in pipeline after Stage 1
python3 qa/pre_evaluate_script.py
python3 qa/pre_evaluate_script.py assets/script_data.json   # explicit path

# Check broll clip quality AFTER Stage 2 — screens for watermarks and generic stock footage
# Returns failed section IDs — runs automatically in pipeline before Stage 5 render
python3 broll/check_broll_quality.py
python3 broll/check_broll_quality.py hook body_1 trigger_2     # check specific clips
```

## Architecture Overview

**Execution flow:** Stage 1 runs first (serial). Stages 2, 3, 4 run in parallel via `ThreadPoolExecutor`. Stage 5 runs last after all three complete. After stage 5 Whisper step, run `sync_broll_to_speech.py` before the Remotion render to align timestamps.

**Crash recovery:** `pipeline_state.json` tracks which stages have completed. Re-running `pipeline.py` auto-resumes from the last incomplete stage.

**Stale-asset guard:** On resume, pipeline compares `script_data.json` mtime against `avatar_video.mp4` and each broll clip. If the script is newer than an asset (i.e. script was regenerated after that asset was built), the stale file is **deleted** and its stage is reset. This prevents old avatar/broll from being composited against a new script. Stage 5 is also reset if either Stage 2 or Stage 3 was reset.

**Data contract between stages:** All stages communicate through `assets/script_data.json` (written by Stage 1, read by all others). The schema is defined in the Stage 1 section below — do not change field names without updating all consumers.

**Remotion data flow:** Stage 5 reads `assets/script_data.json` AND `assets/captions/avatar_video.json`, inlines both as `--props` to Remotion. `ReelComposition.tsx` receives `scriptData` + `captionsData` as props. `captionsData` is passed directly to `HormoziCaptions` — no async fetch at render time. No stage writes directly into the `remotion/` directory at runtime.

**BGM timing:** `bgm_dip_timestamps` in script JSON are Whisper-aligned by `sync_broll_to_speech.py` (actual trigger speech timestamps, not planned). Converted to frames inside Remotion's `<Audio>` volume callback. BGM files are short (~1.5s) — `loop={true}` on the `<Audio>` elements fills the full duration. Track switch at `bgm_transition_sec` uses `delay={bgm_transition_sec * fps}`.

**Caption sync:** Whisper runs on `assets/avatar/avatar_video.mp4` with `--word_timestamps True`. Output lands in `assets/captions/avatar_video.json`. `HormoziCaptions.tsx` flattens segments into a flat word list, post-processes to merge hyphen-continuation tokens and strip trailing punctuation, then shows a 3-word sliding window with the active word highlighted in `#FFD700`. No `fetch()` or `delayRender` — all data passes via props.

**Broll-speech sync:** HeyGen avatar video runs longer than the planned script (e.g. 76s vs 60s planned). `sync_broll_to_speech.py` matches first 3–4 words of each section's `spoken` text against the Whisper word list, extracts actual start timestamps, and rewrites section `start_sec`/`end_sec` in `script_data.json`. Also updates `bgm_dip_timestamps`, `bgm_transition_sec`, and `total_duration_sec`. The Remotion composition duration is set dynamically via `calculateMetadata` reading `total_duration_sec`.

After syncing, the script prints a match summary: `10/10 sections matched` or lists which sections fell back to interpolated timestamps. Fallback sections may be slightly out of sync. Using `WHISPER_MODEL=large-v3` minimises fallbacks.

**Composition duration:** `Root.tsx` uses `calculateMetadata` to compute `durationInFrames = Math.ceil(total_duration_sec * 30)`. This means the render covers the full avatar video — no abrupt cuts.

## What This Project Does

End-to-end automation pipeline that takes a topic or transcript and produces a fully
edited 60-second vertical reel (9:16) ready to post on Instagram / YouTube Shorts.

```
Topic / Transcript
    → Script (Claude API + GOAT Framework, DSSCL loop until ≥ 9.5)
    → B-Roll videos per section (Kie.ai — Kling or Runway)
    → Avatar talking-head video (HeyGen API)
    → Background music tracks x2 (Kie.ai — ElevenLabs sound-effect-v2)
    → Final composite (Remotion): B-roll top 50% | Avatar bottom 50%
    → Hormozi-style captions burned in (Whisper → @remotion/captions)
    → On-screen text overlays per section timestamp
    → BGM mixed with dips at trigger points
    → Output: final_reel.mp4 (9:16, 1080x1920)
```

## ═══════════════════════════════════════════
## STAGE 1 — VIRAL SCRIPT GENERATOR (GOAT FRAMEWORK)
## ═══════════════════════════════════════════

**File:** `stages/stage1_script.py`

This is the complete viral script generator embedded directly in this project.
Claude Code must implement Stage 1 using this framework exactly as specified.

---

### Your Role as Script Generator

You are an Instagram scriptwriting expert who creates viral short-form video scripts
(30–90 seconds) that maximize retention, hook people instantly, and deliver the most
value per second. You write for @automatewithanand targeting AI automation content.

**Core audience:** Entrepreneurs, coaches, creators, and business owners who want
to grow faster, earn more, and break free from limitations.

---

### Non-Negotiable Writing Rules

- **Hook in the first 3 seconds** — bold statement, open loop, surprising fact,
  emotional trigger. Stop the scroll immediately.
- **No filler** — no welcome intros, no wasted sentences. Every word earns its place.
- **Conversational language** — spoken on camera, 8th-grade readability.
- **Active voice only** — never passive.
- **Single core idea** — one script, one message, maximum clarity.
- **Deep research** — real examples, real numbers. No generic claims.
- **Originality** — fresh angle every time. Never reuse prior examples.
- **Emotional drivers** — desire, fear, urgency, identity, transformation.
- **Shareability test** — "Will viewer send this to 3 friends right now?" If not → rewrite.
- **Build to a climax** — end with a "I need to act NOW" moment.

---

### STEP 0 — Load Reference Files First (MANDATORY)

Before generating any script content, read both files:

```
reference/english-hooks.md    ← 200 hook templates with blanks
reference/content-formats.md  ← 47 content format structures
```

**Hook selection:**
1. Scan all 200 hooks in `english-hooks.md`
2. Pick 2–3 best-fit hooks for the topic
3. Fill blanks with AI/automation-specific language
4. Pick the strongest → use as HOOK (0–5 sec)
5. Store chosen hook number in `hook_used` field of JSON output

**Format selection:**
1. Use the goal→format lookup table at the bottom of `content-formats.md`
2. Pick format that best matches content goal
3. Use that format's structure as backbone for CONTEXT → TRIGGER → TAKEAWAY
4. Store chosen format number in `format_used` field of JSON output

---

### STEP 1 — Audience Persona (Default for this channel)

```
WHO:      Age 22–45, working professionals in India
PAIN:     Job insecurity, wasting time, missing out, wanting more income
LANGUAGE: Conversational English
FEARS:    Being replaced by AI, being left behind
WANTS:    Income freedom, leverage, time back, status as an expert
```

The hook must speak to the LARGEST possible slice of this audience (big TAM).
Broader hook = more people stop scrolling.

---

### STEP 2 — DSSCL Virality Filter

Score the script on 5 signals before saving. D + S + S are non-negotiable.

| Signal | Priority | What drives it |
|--------|----------|----------------|
| **D — Double Watch** | 🔴 Highest | Info density, curiosity loops, emotional trigger, rewatch value |
| **S — Share** | 🔴 High | Quotable lines, identity signal, "be first to share this" |
| **S — Save** | 🔴 High | Concrete takeaway, tool name, FOMO, bookmark-worthy |
| **C — Comment** | 🟡 Medium | Debate trigger, relatable frustration, opinion bait |
| **L — Like** | 🟢 Low | General quality — follows naturally if above are strong |

**Scoring formula:**
```
Final = (D × 0.30) + (Share × 0.25) + (Save × 0.25) + (C × 0.10) + (L × 0.10)
```

**Pass thresholds:**
- D ≥ 9.0, Share ≥ 9.0, Save ≥ 9.0, C ≥ 7.0
- **Final ≥ 9.5** ← pipeline will not proceed until this is met

**If score < 9.5**, send this feedback prompt to Claude and regenerate:
```
Script scored {score}/10. Pipeline requires ≥ 9.5. Iteration {n}/5.
Weakest signals: {lowest_two_dimensions}

Required fixes:
- Hook: needs stronger pattern interrupt + broader TAM
- Grand Takeaway: must be more quotable (people screenshot this line)
- Save trigger: must name a specific tool OR give a time estimate

Rewrite keeping same 10-section structure. Return only the JSON object.
```

**Max 5 iterations.** If still < 9.5 after 5 tries → log warning, use best score achieved, continue pipeline.

---

### STEP 3 — The 60-Second Reel Structure

All 10 sections are MANDATORY. Do not skip or merge any.

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  0  – 5 sec   │  HOOK           pattern interrupt       │
│  5  – 10 sec  │  CONTEXT        bridge hook to content  │
│  10 – 12 sec  │  TRIGGER 1      spike — BGM dip         │
│  12 – 20 sec  │  BODY 1         develop the loop        │
│  20 – 25 sec  │  TRIGGER 2      spike — stat/contrast   │
│  25 – 30 sec  │  BODY 2         make it personal        │
│  30 – 32 sec  │  TRIGGER 3      spike — real story/nums │
│  32 – 35 sec  │  BRIDGE         emotional pivot         │
│  35 – 40 sec  │  GRAND TAKEAWAY quotable line           │
│  40 – 60 sec  │  EMOTION + SAVE CTA + specific tool     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**HOOK (0–5 sec):**
- From `english-hooks.md` — blanks filled with AI/automation language
- Pattern interrupt — say something the viewer did NOT expect
- Open a loop, NEVER close it in the hook (Zeigarnik effect)
- Big TAM — broad enough to stop anyone in the target audience
- ❌ Weak: "AI is changing everything."
- ✅ Strong: "Your competitor just replaced you with a ₹2,000/month tool. And you don't even know it yet."

**TRIGGERS (all 3):**
- Tease ONLY — never explain at the trigger point
- Each trigger = BGM dip (micro-silence, marks `bgm_dip: true` in JSON)
- Trigger 3 must include a real-world example with specific numbers
  (city, tool name, rupee/dollar amount, time saved)

**GRAND TAKEAWAY (35–40 sec):**
- 1–2 sentences, spoken slowly and clearly
- Must be QUOTABLE — this is the screenshot line people share
- BGM hard-transitions here: tension track → warm piano track
- Mark `bgm_transition_here: true` in JSON

**EMOTION + SAVE (40–60 sec):**
- Warm friend-to-friend energy, not corporate
- MUST name ONE specific tool (n8n / ChatGPT / Zapier / etc.)
  OR give ONE specific time estimate ("takes 20 minutes to set up")
- CTA last — only after delivering value

---

### STEP 4 — Production Specs Per Section

Each section in the JSON must include:

**`broll_prompt`** — cinematic scene for Kie.ai to generate:
```
Pattern: {subject}, {motion}, {color_palette}, cinematic, no text, no faces, 9:16 vertical, {mood}

Mood by section type:
- hook / triggers:      dark, tension, red accent, dramatic
- body sections:        neutral cinematic, blue accent, informational  
- bridge:               transitional, shifting from dark to warm
- grand_takeaway:       clean, minimal, warm
- emotion_save:         warm, hopeful, golden light
```

**`on_screen_text`** — array of strings, each max 3–5 words:
```json
["CALCULATOR.", "TOOL.", "EMPLOYEE."]
```

**`expression_cue`** — how the avatar should look:
- "dead serious, eyes locked into camera"
- "raised eyebrow, slight smirk"
- "leans in hard, drops voice"
- "warm smile, friend-to-friend energy"

**`vocal_direction`** — how the avatar should sound:
- "slow and deliberate, one word at a time"
- "drops voice at end of sentence"
- "building energy, faster pace"

---

### STEP 5 — Script JSON Output Schema

Stage 1 outputs `assets/script_data.json`. Exact schema:

### STEP 6 — Virality Self-Check (run before saving JSON)

```
[ ] Hook is from english-hooks.md — blanks filled, not generic
[ ] Format from content-formats.md is clearly reflected in structure
[ ] Hook is a pattern interrupt — viewer did NOT expect this
[ ] Hook targets big TAM — broad enough to stop anyone in audience
[ ] Exactly 3 triggers at correct timestamps with bgm_dip: true
[ ] Grand Takeaway is 1–2 quotable, screenshot-worthy sentences
[ ] emotion_save section names ONE specific tool OR time estimate
[ ] bgm_transition_here: true on grand_takeaway section only
[ ] All on_screen_text entries: max 3–5 words each
[ ] broll_prompt present in every section (cinematic, no text, no faces, 9:16)
[ ] expression_cue and vocal_direction present in every section
[ ] DSSCL final score ≥ 9.5
```

### GOAT Virality Formula

```
character + delivery + content = virality

TAM × Curiosity × Relevance = Attention + Dopamine

good TAM + unique content     = viral + credibility      ✅
good TAM + average content    = no reach, no credibility  ❌
small TAM + unique + trigger  = good reach + credibility  ✅
small TAM + average + trigger = no reach, no credibility  ❌
```

Growth milestones:
- 0–10k:    Virality alone
- 10k–30k:  Virality + strong on-screen person
- 30k–70k:  Virality + person + positioning
- 70k–100k: Virality + person + positioning + credibility

You only need 6–10 viral videos to reach 100K.
Build every script like it's one of those 10.

## ═══════════════════════════════════════════
## STAGE 2 — B-ROLL GENERATION (Kie.ai)
## ═══════════════════════════════════════════

**File:** `stages/stage2_broll.py`

Two-step pipeline: nano-banana-2 (Imagen) → Kling I2V. Falls back to T2V if either step fails.

1. Read `assets/script_data.json`
2. For each section:
   - Submit `broll_prompt` to nano-banana-2 (Imagen) via Kie.ai jobs API → get reference PNG
   - Submit PNG + motion prompt to Kling I2V → get cinematic video
   - If either step fails → fall back to Kling T2V directly
3. Poll every 15 seconds until `completed`
4. Download MP4 to `assets/broll/{section.id}.mp4`
5. **Re-encode to H264 Baseline** immediately after download (Chromium/Remotion rejects High/Main profile):
   `ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libx264 -profile:v baseline -level 3.1 -pix_fmt yuv420p -movflags +faststart -y output.mp4`
6. Verify non-zero filesize before marking complete
7. Force T2V for all sections: set `BROLL_MODEL=kling-2.6/text-to-video` in `.env`

## ═══════════════════════════════════════════
## STAGE 3 — AVATAR GENERATION (HeyGen)
## ═══════════════════════════════════════════

**File:** `stages/stage3_avatar.py`

1. Read `full_spoken_script` from `assets/script_data.json`
2. Submit to HeyGen v2/video/generate
3. Poll every 20 seconds
4. Download to `assets/avatar/avatar_video.mp4`
5. Black background (#000000) enables clean compositing

## ═══════════════════════════════════════════
## STAGE 4 — BACKGROUND MUSIC (Kie.ai)
## ═══════════════════════════════════════════

**File:** `stages/stage4_music.py`

Generates **6 audio files** in parallel (ThreadPoolExecutor max_workers=5):

1. Submit all 6 tasks simultaneously to Kie.ai ElevenLabs
2. Poll all in parallel
3. Download to `assets/music/`:
   - `track1_tension.mp3` — dark orchestral underscore, fills 0→bgm_transition_sec
   - `track2_warm.mp3` — warm piano, fills bgm_transition_sec→end
   - `sting1.mp3` — impact hit at trigger 1 timestamp
   - `sting2.mp3` — impact hit at trigger 2 timestamp
   - `sting3.mp3` — impact hit at trigger 3 timestamp
   - `hook_sting.mp3` — dramatic orchestral boom at video start (first 3s)

Prompts:
- Track 1: "cinematic dark orchestral impact, deep sub bass, tense thriller underscore, heart-pounding dramatic atmosphere, builds suspense, no melody, 35 seconds"
- Track 2: "warm hopeful soft piano melody, uplifting gentle beat, positive transformation, 25 seconds"
- Stings: "dramatic cinematic impact sting, single deep sub bass hit, tension spike moment, heart-pounding, no melody, 2 seconds"
- Hook sting: "dramatic cinematic orchestral boom, powerful low frequency hit, epic movie trailer opening, thunder crack, reverberant impact, no melody, 3 seconds"

BGM dip behavior (from Whisper-aligned `bgm_dip_timestamps`):
- At each trigger timestamp: BGM volume drops to 0.03 for ~25 frames, sting plays at 0.70
- At `bgm_transition_sec`: Track 1 ends, Track 2 begins (hard cut)
- ElevenLabs files are ~1.5s — Remotion `loop={true}` fills full duration
- Implemented in Remotion `<Audio>` volume callback (Stage 5)

## ═══════════════════════════════════════════
## STAGE 5 — REMOTION COMPOSITION
## ═══════════════════════════════════════════

**File:** `stages/stage5_compose.py`
**Remotion project:** `remotion/`
**Skill:** `npx claude-code-templates@latest --skill video/remotion`

Stage 5 runs Whisper, then syncs timestamps, then triggers Remotion render:

```bash
# Step 1: Generate word-level captions from avatar audio
# large-v3 model gives best accuracy on proper nouns (Claude, n8n, HeyGen, etc.)
# First run downloads ~1.5GB model — subsequent runs use cache
whisper assets/avatar/avatar_video.mp4 \
  --model large-v3 \
  --output_format json \
  --output_dir assets/captions/ \
  --word_timestamps True

# Step 2: Align broll section timestamps to actual speech
python3 speech/sync_broll_to_speech.py

# Step 3: Remotion render (scriptData + captionsData both inlined into props)
npx remotion render remotion/src/index.ts ReelComposition \
  --props='{"scriptData":{...},"assetsDir":"assets","captionsData":{...}}' \
  --output assets/final/final_reel.mp4 \
  --width 1080 --height 1920 --fps 30
```

Stage 5 Python loads `assets/script_data.json` and `assets/captions/avatar_video.json` and merges both into the `--props` JSON at render time. No fetching inside Remotion at render time.

### Final Video Spec
- Resolution: 1080 × 1920 (9:16 vertical)
- FPS: 30
- Duration: dynamic — `Math.ceil(total_duration_sec * 30)` frames (set by sync script from Whisper; typically ~76–80s)

### Layout

```
┌──────────────────────────┐  ← y: 0px
│   TITLE HEADER           │  1080 × 160px  white bg, 2-line title (red + black)
├──────────────────────────┤  ← y: 160px
│                          │
│   AVATAR (full frame)    │  1080 × 1400px  gradient bg, beauty filter
│                          │
│   ┌────────────────────┐ │  B-ROLL BOX (during b-roll window):
│   │  B-ROLL CLIP       │ │  880×1100px, centered, BOX_TOP=310, BOX_LEFT=100
│   │  Ken Burns zoom    │ │  portrait orientation (minimises 9:16 crop)
│   └────────────────────┘ │
│                          │
│   [falling leaf particles during A-roll window]
│                          │
├──────────────────────────┤  ← y: 1560px
│   SAFE ZONE (white)      │  1080 × 360px  captions + Instagram UI padding
└──────────────────────────┘  ← y: 1920px
```

**A/B rhythm:** 8s avatar (A-roll) → 4s b-roll box (B-roll) = 12s cycle. Flash + click at each cut.
During b-roll window: gradient overlay covers avatar, b-roll box sits on top. No avatar visible.

### Remotion Components

**`Root.tsx`**
- `calculateMetadata` reads `total_duration_sec` from props: `durationInFrames = Math.ceil(total_duration_sec * 30)`
- Default ceiling: `durationInFrames={2700}` (90s) as fallback
- `defaultProps` includes `captionsData: { segments: [], text: "" }` for Studio preview

**`ReelComposition.tsx`**
- Receives `scriptData`, `assetsDir`, `captionsData` as props
- Owns all `<Audio>` elements — avatar voice + trigger stings (BGM tracks removed)
- StatCard is NOT present — text stat overlays were removed. All sections use b-roll clips.

**`TitleHeader.tsx`**
- Static white bar at y=0→160, zIndex=40
- `splitTitle()` splits on ` — ` or `:` — max 4 words per line to prevent overflow
- line1: red `#E31A1A`, fontSize=44, weight=900; line2: black `#111`, fontSize=40, weight=800

**`AvatarPanel.tsx`**
- Full avatar zone (1080×1400, `top: 160`)
- `objectFit: "cover"`, `objectPosition: "50% 65%"`, `transformOrigin: "50% 35%"`, `BASE_ZOOM: 1.4`
- Gradient background: `linear-gradient(180deg, #0a0a12, #111827, #080810)`
- CSS beauty filter: `brightness(1.15) contrast(1.10) saturate(1.20)`

**`BrollClipCard.tsx`**
- B-roll box overlay during b-roll window only (4s of every 12s cycle)
- `BOX_WIDTH=880, BOX_HEIGHT=1100, BOX_LEFT=100, BOX_TOP=310, BOX_RADIUS=28`
- During b-roll window: full gradient overlay (zIndex=19) covers avatar, box (zIndex=20) on top
- Ken Burns zoom: 1.0 → 1.08 (regular sections), 1.0 → 1.14 (trigger sections)
- `loop` on `<Video>` fills 4s window from a 5s clip

**`ArollParticles.tsx`**
- 8 falling white oval leaf shapes during A-roll window, hidden during b-roll window
- Opacity 14–25%, independent loop timing per particle, zIndex=18

**`RhythmCuts.tsx`**
- White flash (6 frames) + sting click at every A→B cut
- `AROLL_SECS=8, CYCLE_SECS=12, CYCLE_FRAMES=288, AROLL_FRAMES=192`
- Sting volume: 0.20

**`SectionFlash.tsx`**
- 2-frame black flash before any section with `flash_before: true` (trigger sections)
- zIndex=100

**`HormoziCaptions.tsx`**
- Data via `captionsData` prop (no fetch at render time)
- `extractWords()`: merges hyphen tokens, strips trailing punctuation, corrects Whisper mishears (clot/clode/claud → "Claude")
- 3-word sliding window, active word in `#FF3D00`
- `CAPTION_BOTTOM_PX=440`, gap=20px between words, fontSize=72, weight=900
- `WebkitTextStroke: "4px black"`

**`LowerThird.tsx`** — `@automatewithanand` handle slides in for first 8s, `AVATAR_PANEL_TOP=160`

**`EndCard.tsx`** — FOLLOW overlay for last 2s of video

### Audio in Remotion

BGM bed tracks (track1_tension, track2_warm, hook_sting) have been **removed** — user found them annoying. Do not add them back.

Active audio mix:
| Track | Volume | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Avatar voice | 4.0 | `playbackRate=1.25` to match sped-up video |
| Trigger stings (sting1/2/3) | 0.20 | At each bgm_dip_timestamp via RhythmCuts |

```typescript
// Avatar voice at 1.25x playback
<Audio src={avatarPath} volume={4.0} playbackRate={PLAYBACK_RATE} />

// Trigger stings at Whisper-aligned timestamps (via Sequence)
<Sequence from={bgmDipFrames[0]} durationInFrames={Math.round(2 * fps)}>
  <Audio src={sting1Path} volume={0.20} />
</Sequence>
// ... sting2, sting3 same pattern
```

## ═══════════════════════════════════════════
## STAGE 6 — VIDEO DSSCL ANALYSER
## ═══════════════════════════════════════════

**File:** `stages/stage6_analyse.py`

Analyses the rendered `assets/final/final_reel.mp4` using Claude vision (Opus model).
Returns DSSCL scores and feedback. If score < 9.0, `pipeline.py` loops back to Stage 1.

**What it does:**
1. Extracts 12 frames evenly spaced across the video using `ffprobe` + `ffmpeg` (scaled to 540px wide, JPEG)
2. Sends all frames as a multi-image message to Claude Opus vision API
3. Scores on DSSCL formula: `Final = D×0.30 + Share×0.25 + Save×0.25 + C×0.10 + L×0.10`
4. Recalculates `final` score from raw components (doesn't trust Claude's arithmetic)
5. Writes analysis to `assets/analysis/video_analysis.json`
6. Returns `passed: true` if `final ≥ 9.0`

**Frame evaluation covers:**
- Hook (first 2 frames): scroll-stop, pattern interrupt, open loop
- B-roll (top 50%): quality, relevance, no text/watermarks
- On-screen text: legibility, punch, max 3–5 words
- Avatar (bottom 50%): energy, lighting, eye contact
- Captions: Hormozi style, sync, visibility
- Grand Takeaway frame: quotable line clearly visible
- CTA / emotion_save: warm close, specific tool named

**Output:** `assets/analysis/video_analysis.json`
```json
{
  "dsscl_scores": { "D": 8.5, "Share": 9.0, "Save": 9.0, "C": 7.5, "L": 8.0, "final": 8.63 },
  "passed": false,
  "strengths": ["strong hook", "clear CTA"],
  "weaknesses": ["B-roll not matching speech", "grand takeaway not quotable enough"],
  "script_feedback": "Specific script improvements for next iteration...",
  "visual_feedback": "B-roll, caption, avatar quality notes..."
}
```

**Pipeline loop behavior (in `pipeline.py`):**
- Max 3 outer pipeline iterations
- If `passed: false` → resets stages 1, 2, 3, 5 (keeps stage 4 music) → re-runs with video feedback
- Stage 1 receives `video_feedback` dict → prepends `build_video_feedback_prompt()` to script prompt
- If still < 9.0 after 3 iterations → accepts best result, logs warning

### Execution Model

```
Stage 1 (script) ←──────────────────────────────────────────┐
    ↓                                                        │ video_feedback
    ├── Stage 2 (broll)  ─┐                                  │ (script regenerated)

    └── Stage 4 (music)  ─┘                                  │
                          ↓ (wait for all 3)                 │
                     Stage 5 (compose)                       │
                          ↓                                  │
                     Stage 6 (analyse) ── score < 9.0 ───────┘
                          │
                     score ≥ 9.0 (or max 3 iterations)
                          ↓
                  assets/final/final_reel.mp4
```

**Note:** Stage 4 (music) is generated only once — it does not depend on script content so it is not re-run in the video analysis loop. Only stages 1, 2, 3, 5 reset per iteration.

### Crash Recovery State

Writes `pipeline_state.json` after each stage. Re-running auto-resumes:

```json
{

### Backend Standards (from senior-backend skill)

- All API calls: 3 retries, exponential backoff (1s → 2s → 4s)
- All downloads: verify non-zero filesize, retry on failure
- All stages: structured logging to `logs/pipeline.log` with timestamps + stage name
- Stage return type: `{"success": bool, "output_path": str, "duration_sec": float, "error": str|None}`
- All secrets via `.env` + `python-dotenv` — never hardcoded
- Parallel stages via `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor`
- Graceful SIGINT handling: save state before exit

## COMMON ERRORS & FIXES
## ═══════════════════════════════════════════

| Error | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| Kie.ai 422 | Missing `aspect_ratio` for text-to-video | Add `"aspect_ratio": "9:16"` to request body |
| Kie.ai 451 | `imageUrl` not publicly accessible | Omit `imageUrl` for pure text-to-video |
| Kie.ai 401 | Wrong auth header format | Use `Authorization: Bearer $KIE_API_KEY` |
| Kie.ai 402 | Insufficient credits | Top up at kie.ai dashboard before running |
| HeyGen `failed` status | Script too long or wrong avatar_id | Trim to <5000 chars, verify `HEYGEN_AVATAR_ID` in .env |
| HeyGen 401 | Wrong header name | Use `X-Api-Key` not `Authorization` |
| Remotion `MEDIA_ELEMENT_ERROR Code 4` on broll | Kling generates H264 High/Main profile — Chromium rejects it | Re-encode every clip after download: `ffmpeg -i in.mp4 -c:v libx264 -profile:v baseline -level 3.1 -pix_fmt yuv420p -movflags +faststart -y out.mp4` |
| Remotion OOM on render | Too many concurrent video inputs | Remotion handles sequentially — don't load all clips at once |
| Remotion render 404 on avatar | Run from wrong directory | Always `cd remotion && npx remotion render ...` — never from project root with `--prefix` |
| Video abruptly cuts at 60s | `durationInFrames={1800}` hardcoded OR `sync_broll_to_speech.py` not run | Use `calculateMetadata` in Root.tsx; always run sync before Remotion render |
| Old avatar used in new video | Pipeline resumed from state; Stage 3 skip guard short-circuits on existing file | Stale-asset guard now deletes the file automatically on mtime mismatch. Manual fix: `rm assets/avatar/avatar_video.mp4` |
| Old broll used in new video | Same stale-asset issue | Stale-asset guard deletes stale clips automatically. Manual fix: `rm assets/broll/*.mp4` |
| Captions misidentify words ("clot" instead of "Claude") | Whisper `small.en` inaccurate on proper nouns | Preferred: set `STT_PROVIDER=elevenlabs` + `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` in `.env` (~$0.013/reel). Free fallback: set `WHISPER_MODEL=large-v3`. |
| Caption shows "FOLLOW -UPS" split | Whisper splits hyphenated words | `extractWords()` merges tokens starting with "-" into previous word |
| sync_broll_to_speech shows FALLBACK sections | Whisper couldn't match section's first words | Upgrade to `large-v3`; fallback sections use interpolated timestamps |
| Broll clips show text/watermarks | Prompt doesn't explicitly forbid them | Add "absolutely no text overlays, no watermarks, no subtitles, no captions, pure cinematic footage only" to every broll_prompt |
| Broll/speech not in sync | HeyGen speaks at natural pace (differs from planned timing) | Run `sync_broll_to_speech.py` after Whisper — pipeline does this automatically in Stage 5 |
| Title header too long | Full title exceeds 4 words per line | `splitTitle()` in TitleHeader.tsx truncates to max 4 words per line |
| stage1_script.py NameError: name 'text' | `{text, size}` unescaped in f-string | Escape as `{{text, size}}` in any f-string containing literal braces |
| DSSCL loop > 5 | Claude can't hit 9.5 | Log warning, use best score, continue pipeline |

## ═══════════════════════════════════════════
## SHORT-FORM FORMAT LIBRARY & EDIT DECISION ENGINE
## ═══════════════════════════════════════════

Built 2026-07 by replicating Dan Martell's proven formats (view data scraped +
frame-analyzed + transcribed per reel). These standalone compositors BYPASS the
10-section pipeline. All use existing avatar footage + ffmpeg/PIL — the only
paid step is one HeyGen render per new script.

### The library

| Script | Format | Script pattern | Status |
|--------|--------|----------------|--------|
| `formats/tier_stack.py` | Bad/Good/Great — 3 blurred logo cards per category, un-blur on spoken word, question pill | "For X: A is bad. B is good. C is great." | Production |
| `formats/tier_board.py` | S-F tier board — items float then land in colored rows, accumulate | "[ITEM]. [GRADE]. [one punchy reason]." | Production |
| `formats/tier_timeline.py` | Stage/timeline board — left rail of stage badges, items land beside them | "[ITEM]. [STAGE]. [reason]." | Production |
| `formats/countdown.py` | Countdown 5→1 + LIVE screen-demo cards + CTA pill | "Number N, [Tool]. [what it does]. [proof number]." | Production |
| `formats/checklist.py` | 5-step rainbow checklist — all steps ghosted from t=0, light up per beat | "Step N: [action]" (Authority how-to) | Demo — needs matching HeyGen script |
| `formats/sort_board.py` | 3-column sort — Matters/Doesn't/Hurtful headers, items land under columns | "[HABIT]. [Verdict]. [reason]." | Demo — needs matching HeyGen script |
| `formats/timer.py` | Live countdown timer card (ffmpeg drawtext expression) + reframe monologue | Time-boxed promise → chained quotables | Demo — needs matching HeyGen script |
| `formats/viral_15s.py` | 15s pure-virality cut, Hormozi word captions | Harsha 4-beat (hook/reveal/proof+dream/CTA) | Production |
| `formats/authority_stack.py` | Full-frame avatar + logo pops synced to speech | Tier list without board | Production |

### Edit decision engine — given a script/topic, pick the format

1. **Compares tools per category** ("X bad / Y good / Z great") → `tier_stack_reel`
2. **Grades many items by quality** → `tier_board_reel` (S-F)
3. **Sequences by WHEN** (life stage / revenue stage / timeline) → `tier_timeline_reel`
4. **Binary/ternary judgment on habits or beliefs** (matters / doesn't / hurtful) → `sort_board_reel`
5. **"Top N tools" with proof** → `countdown_reel` (live screen demos mandatory — static cards look fake)
6. **Step-by-step system / how-to (Authority)** → `checklist_reel`
7. **Motivational reframe with a time promise** → `timer_reel`
8. **Pure 15s reveal/intrigue (Virality)** → `viral_15s`
9. **AI-news long-form** → the original 10-section pipeline (Fri slot)

Tie-breakers (from Dan's own view data): visible-framework formats beat b-roll
countdowns 5-10× on the SAME topic (his "3 habits" b-roll reel: 18K vs 84K+
median — the board version of the same content did 5-10×). When two formats
fit, pick the one whose full board/list at the end is most screenshot-worthy.

### Non-negotiable edit rules (user + mentor approved)

- **No hook on board formats** — first frame already shows the framework (blurred/ghosted = the suspense). Straight into item 1.
- **Framework visible from frame 1**, reveals synced to Scribe word timestamps (reveal = word_start − 0.15s).
- **End the instant the last payoff lands.** Board formats: CTA in caption only. Conversion formats: spoken keyword CTA ("Comment X and I'll send…").
- **Dark pills behind ALL landed text** — raw white text drowns in the warm studio background.
- **Chest-level crop, 1.66× zoom** (1.87× was rejected as too zoomed). Grey avatar: `crop=650:1156:185:144`. Blue avatar: `crop=591:1050:179:250`. Always verify per avatar — framing differs.
- **Studio background**: `editing/replace_background.py --style studio` (RVM matting; also `warm|blue|teal|image`).
- **Light-leak flash at reveals/cuts** (~0.22s warm wash + brightness pulse) — polish, added after format is locked.
- **1.3× final speed** (HeyGen speaks ~142wpm; 1.3× ≈ 185wpm = Martell zone), then thumbnail concat.
- **Contrarian placements are the comment engine** — at least one verdict per reel must make people argue.

### Screen-demo recording (for countdown_reel)

Three tiers — see `capture/record_tool_demos.mjs`, `capture/record_logged_in.mjs`, `capture/capture_window.py`:
1. Playwright headless on PUBLIC pages (challenge-detection built in; Wayback Machine `web.archive.org/web/<yr>/<url>` beats Cloudflare walls e.g. elevenlabs.io)
2. Logged-in Chrome profile copy (user quits Chrome first; works for most apps; NOT claude.ai — device-bound sessions)
3. Real Chrome + AppleScript + `screencapture -R` from READ-BACK window bounds (the claude.ai route; needs VS Code Screen Recording + Accessibility permissions; `screencapture -v` ignores `-l` window flag; verify Chrome frontmost before keystrokes; privacy-crop tabs/bookmarks/sidebar)

### Instagram reference-reel analysis method

GraphQL `doc_id=10015901848480474` + `variables={"shortcode":"..."}` + header
`x-ig-app-id: 936619743392459` → `video_url` → download IMMEDIATELY (tokens
expire). Then: 8-12 frames via ffmpeg + Scribe transcription
(`speech/transcribe_elevenlabs.py`) → format = layout + script pattern + timing.

### Format #8 — Editorial process walkthrough (nick_saraev style, Danc08PA0kz)

`scripts/process_reel.py` (demo). Bright/editorial opposite of the Dan Martell
dark-studio boards — and the closest format to this channel's niche (the
reference reel is literally "build an app with Claude Code").

- Layout alternates every 3-5s: SPLIT (demo card on cream top half, tight face
  bottom half) ↔ full-frame face ↔ full-frame card.
- **Red cross slash**: thick red diagonal over a terminal/code screenshot at the
  negation phrase ("zero CODING skills") — the hook compressed into one image.
- Phrase-accumulating captions, mixed typography: serif-italic emphasis words +
  bold sans, mid-frame.
- Real product demos as proof (terminal running Claude Code, app UI, QR code,
  approval card) — use the 3-tier screen recording stack.
- Bright editorial backdrop: `replace_background.py --style editorial`
  (cream + soft leaf shadow).
- Script pattern: "You can now X with zero Y" → "Here's the full process" →
  First/Next/Then/Finally with demos → course/resource pitch → keyword CTA.

#### Format #8 addendum — rrishijain variant (DanB7ViPQrr, "Claude + Arcads paper animations")

Same editorial-walkthrough family; five additional edits to reuse:
1. **Result-first cold open** — the finished output plays full-frame in the first
   2s, BEFORE any explanation. For pipeline/tutorial reels: open with the
   finished reel playing, never with "let me show you how".
2. **Logo-pairing card** — white card, "✻ Claude + [tool]" logos side by side,
   shown at open and close. One PIL function; logos in assets/tier_cards/real_logos/.
3. **Deep real-UI walkthrough incl. the Connectors/MCP modal** — personalized
   greeting + Add Custom Connector screen + prompts + generated outputs. Use the
   existing capture stack (capture_window.py); MCP content is squarely this niche.
4. **Quoted-keyword CTA styling** — comment "Keyword" in yellow serif italic with
   quotes, while pointing at camera (no solid pill).
5. **Lowercase phrase captions** — small white lowercase mid-frame phrases; the
   third top-creator data point moving away from all-caps word-by-word captions
   on tutorial content.
Also (not compositable): topic-matched physical props on the desk — note for the
videographer session.

| `formats/` | One module per reel format + `registry.py` (decision engine). `python3 formats/<name>.py` or `reel.py make <name>` |
| `capture/` | 3-tier screen recording + `analyze_reference.py` (Instagram reel downloader/dissector) |
| `speech/` | Scribe transcription, broll-speech sync, caption sanitizer |
| `broll/` | Hyperframes generator, screen/terminal renderers, infographics, diagrams, broll QA |
| `editing/` | Background replacement (RVM), viral_edit zoom punches, thumbnail append |
| `qa/` | pre_stage_check, pre_evaluate_script, verify_assets_in_video |
| `scripting/` | Script generators (authority_30s) |
| `reference/` | Hook bank, format bank, harsha_skill (was scripts/reference_scripts) |
| `stages/` + `pipeline.py` | The 10-section long-form pipeline (unchanged) |
| `reel.py` | CLI: `list · decide · make · finish · bg · transcribe · capture · analyze` |
| `.claude/agents/` | reel-analyzer, format-runner, reel-qa subagents |

`scripts/` retains only: learnings/ (stage7 data), generated/, build_docx.py,
download_broll_tasks.py.

**Verified**: the formats/ rewrite reproduces the approved tier_stack render
pixel-identically (frame-diff 0.00 at sampled timestamps).

## ═══════════════════════════════════════════
## AVATAR LOOK LIBRARY (videographer session, 2026-07-12)
## ═══════════════════════════════════════════

5 outfit groups, 17 trained HeyGen looks — full registry with avatar IDs in
`core/looks.py`, env vars `HEYGEN_LOOK_*` in .env. `reel.py looks` to list,
`reel.py render <look> --text "..." --yes` to render (--yes = credit spend).

| Look pair | Setting | Recommended formats |
|-----------|---------|---------------------|
| green_bookshelf_front/side | Warm bookshelf set (the Dan Martell aesthetic) | tier_board, tier_timeline, sort_board, tier_stack — **no background replacement needed** |
| grey_bookshelf_front/side | Bookshelf set, rust chair (seated) | checklist, authority how-to |
| black_blinds/couch/brick | Black crew: bright blinds, brick couch, brick profile | countdown + screen demos, moody virals |
| white_darkwall_front/side | Dark wall, warm sconces, red accent | viral_15s, timer, hero hooks |
| white_chair / blue_chair | Green wingback armchair (seated) | question_bubble, Friday long-form |
| blueshrt_window/stone | Bright window / stone + plant | format #8 editorial walkthrough |

**Rules for using looks:**
- Every look's crop is UNVERIFIED until a test render is framed-checked → add a
  preset to `core/framing.py` and fill `crop=` in `core/looks.py`. Never
  composite on an unverified crop (face position shifts per setting).
- Side-angle looks have off-center faces → MIRROR the UI (face right → boards/
  pills left). `Look.mirror_ui` flags these.
- **Two-camera jump cuts**: each front/side pair (`core/looks.py pairs()`) can
  replicate Dan Martell's multi-cam feel — render the SAME script on both
  angles (2× credits) and alternate cuts at sentence boundaries via Scribe
  timestamps. Reserve for hero reels.
- Real environments mean `editing/replace_background.py` is now OPTIONAL —
  keep it for the branded studio look or messy sources.
- Rotate looks across the weekly calendar so the feed doesn't look like one
  recording session.

### Analyzed template — swap_board (Dan Martell DayaDuKgSfQ)
2-column "don't say / instead say" paired-reveal board (variant of sort_board):
each beat drops a matched pair — bad word left (red), better word right (cyan) —
synced to speech, accumulate to a full-board payoff. Script: "Stop saying X.
Start saying Y. [reason]." Saved as template (memory: project_swap_board_format);
build on request as a 2-column variant of formats/sort_board.py. Decision-engine
rule: paired good/bad word or option swap → swap_board.

### Project skills (.claude/skills/) — added 2026-07-16

- **motion-design** — animated overlays ON avatar footage: `core/motion.py`
  renders GSAP scenes (motion/templates/) on magenta via the hyperframes CLI;
  `OverlayChain.add_video(..., chroma=MAGENTA)` keys them transparent.
  Starter templates: spring_label (pill with back.out overshoot), countup
  (rolling number + underline). Template authoring rules + house motion
  grammar in the SKILL.md. Proven on black_couch 2026-07-16.
- **Arcads pack (vendored, MIT, krusemediallc/arcads-claude-code)** — FULL pack
  now in: `arcads-external-api` (API skill + per-model prompt libraries +
  analyze-video/clone-ad), `nano-banana-image-ad` + `chatgpt-image-ad` +
  `image-ad-clone` (37-template static-ad library in
  `.claude/shared/skills/image-ad-prompting/`), `generate-youtube-thumbnail`
  (5 CTR formulas), plus shared recipes (pixar-style-ad, claymation-ad,
  meta-ad-builder, caption-video) in `.claude/shared/skills/`.
  **DECISION 2026-07-16: no Arcads plan — the Arcads API is never called.**
  Every skill carries a "THIS REPO" routing block: image gen → Kie.ai
  nano-banana-2, b-roll/animate → Kie.ai kling-2.6 I2V, talking heads →
  HeyGen, UI-mockup templates → HTML/PIL. The pack is used as a prompt +
  workflow library on backends this repo already pays for.

### Analyzed template — contrast_stack (Dan Martell Daxw_ESj8u1)
"Broke vs Wealthy" A/B contrast: full-frame avatar + keyword-synced PHOTO-card
pops (one per clause, replace not accumulate), pinned title pill, mid-frame
single-phrase captions, ends on a card-suppressed grand-takeaway. Fork of
authority_stack. Saved as template (memory: project_contrast_stack_format);
build on request. Decision-engine rule: A/B "X does this vs Y does that"
contrast → contrast_stack. Keep dark pills behind captions (our warm bg).
